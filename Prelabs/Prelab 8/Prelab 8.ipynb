It will be due on ***Friday at 9am***, and we will discuss it in an appointment during my office hours 10-11am that day. \n","\n","Below is an excerpt from the Project 2 assignment instructions to help guide you, though I suggest you review the entire assignment document (available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1km7R6j25WvxnFb_bU2YCUELAnA9rByw9pjkKo3dafcw/edit?usp=sharing)) before beginning your proposal \n","\n","---\n","***Purpose:*** \n","\n","Utilize your developing statistical and data visualization skills to design and complete a data-driven investigation of exoplanet properties. You will design the “question” that is the focus of your investigation yourself, in consultation with Prof. Follette. Your question should be something interesting to you, but cannot be something that you’ve looked at directly already in a lab or prelab. \n","\n","***A good question is:***\n","\n","1. Tractable (the data are capable of answering it)\n","\n","2. Specific \n","\n","3. Substantive (the answer is not intuitively obvious)\n","\n","***Constraints/Requirements for Your Investigation:***\n","\n","You must generate at least two well-designed graphics that are informative in the context of your investigation. This graphics must be well designed and well chosen.\n","\n","Your investigation must involve at least three columns of data from the table, and must summarize these quantities quantitatively with summary statistics and/or plots. \n","Your investigation must involve either (a) a fit to a linear trend, or (b) a quantitative evaluation of a hypothesis, or both. \n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","If you haven't already, you should begin with an exploratory investigation of the Exoplanet Database. You are searching for a ***tractable, specific, and substantive*** question that you think the database is capable of answering. For example, in your Lab 6 reports, you investigated the question (Note it's formulated as two questions, but they are related, so it \"counts\" as one): \n","\n","*How strongly are planet mass and radius related? Is there more than one relationship evident in the data?*. \n","\n","Your Prelab 8 Project Proposal should basically be a formulation and justification of two such questions that you think might be suitable for your Project 2 report. I will help you to choose between the two and will give you some guidance on where to find the relevant background information, things to watch out for as you complete your investigation, etc. during our meeting on Friday.  \n","\n","You should use the remainder of this notebook to lay out:\n","\n","1) At least two possible questions that you think the database is capable of answering. You need to ***demonstrate*** their feasibility with exploratory or preliminary graphics and statistical calculations. \n","\n","2) For each of your two potential questions, you should make a ***data-driven argument*** for why you think the question is sufficiently tractable, specific, and substantive. As always, these should include specific references to the graphics and statistics that informed your choice. \n","\n","3) At the end of your prelab, list three questions that you have for me about the nature of the data, how to complete the analyses you propose, etc. These will form the basis of our discussion at our Friday meeting. \n","\n","The specific requirements are scaffolded below.
