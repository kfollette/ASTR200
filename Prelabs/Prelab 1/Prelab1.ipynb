    "Jupyter notebooks have two kinds of cells. Markdown cells like this one (this probably looks to you like an ordinary block of text, but double click on it to see what I mean by a \"cell\") have no labeling to the left of the cell, and, when executed, appear as ordinary text. Code cells like the one below have `[ ]:` printed to the side of them and, when executed, a number appears inside of the brackets. ***To execute both Markdown and code cells in Jupyter, hit shift + enter inside of that cell***. Try it by double clicking on this cell and hitting shift + enter, and then do the same with the code cell below. Note that a markdown cell becomes pure text when you execute it, while a code cell spits out some output, which will appear below the code cell.\n",

    "The guts of Jupyter is the coding language Python, and any and all Python syntax will work inside of code cells. However, Jupyter code cells also have some extra capabilities, which we will talk about as needed in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Jupyter is that it integrates text (instructions/notes), code ***and*** output all in the same document. For this reason, many astronomers and data scientists use Jupyter as a sort of lab notebook rather than maintaining lab notes, code, and code output all in separate documents. Increasingly, people are publicly releasing their Jupyter notebook data analyses as a means of increasing transparency and reproducibility in their scientific results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Jupyter Cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always keep in mind that ***cells within a Jupyter notebook can be executed and reexecuted in any order*** as this can sometimes get you into trouble. This feature is the reason why an executed code cell is numbered, so that you know what order the cells you see have been executed in. Cell execution is not necessarily linear from the top to the bottom of the document, but can jump around within it. Often, you will note a mistake or something that you want to try and will go back and change the code in an earlier cell. If you reexecute just this one cell, then any already executed cells that rely on variables defined in the reexecuted cell or its output will ***not*** be automatically updated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this class, labs and homeworks should always be executable in a linear fashion, as you will be clearing all output before submitting them. You should observe the following \"best practices\" for coding in notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use descriptive variable labels (e.g. lum_stara = , mass_starb =) and create a new variable name each time you do a calculation. ***Do not reuse variable names*** or you risk referring to one thing when you think you're referring to something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before handing in any lab or homework, restart the kernel with the menu at the top of the notebook and execute the whole thing from start to finish once, making sure that all of your code output is how you want it. Note that ***restarting the kernel will clear the code output, not the code itself***, so you will not be losing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you note a mistake in an earlier cell and go back to correct it, you should be careful to also reexecute any later cells that depend on it. ***If you want to do a calculation similar to one that you executed in a previous cell, you should copy the contents of that cell into a new cell***, rename the variables, and execute it again.

In mathematics, the statement that a = b is a statement that two things are equal, and it can be either true or false. In python, as in almost all other programming languages, a = b means something different. It means that the value of the variable a should be changed to whatever value b has. Thus the statement we made a = a + 1 is not an assertion (which is obviously false) that a is equal to itself plus one. It is an instruction to the computer to take the variable a, and 1 to it, and then store the result back into the variable a. In this example, it therefore changes the value of a from 4 to 5.\n",

The second statement has the opposite effect: the computer forgets what is stored in b, and replaces it by whatever is stored in a.\n",

    "Why have different types of variables for integers versus non-integer real numbers? In mathematics there is no need to make the distinction, of course: all integers are real numbers, so it would seem that there should be no reason to have a separate type of variable to hold integers. However, this ignores the way computers work. On a computer, operations involving integers are exact: 1 + 1 is exactly 2. However, operations on real numbers are necessarily inexact. I say necessarily because a real number is capable of having an arbitrary number of decimal places. The number pi contains infinitely many digits, and never repeats, but my computer only comes with a finite amount of memory and processor power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even rational numbers (like 2/3) run into this problem, because their decimal representation (or to be exact their representation in binary) may be an infinitely repeating sequence. Thus it is not possible to perform operations on arbitrary real numbers to exact precision. Instead, arithmetic operations on floating point numbers are approximate, with the level of accuracy determined by factors like how much memory one wants to devote to storing digits, and how much processor time one wants to spend manipulating them. \n",
    "\n",
    "On most computers a python floating point number is accurate to about 1 in 10^15, but this depends on both the architecture and on the operations you perform. That's enough accuracy for many purposes, but there are plenty of situations (for example counting things) when we really want to do things precisely, and we want 1 + 1 to be exactly 2. That's what integers are there for.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third type of very useful variable is strings, abbreviated str. A string is a sequence of characters, and one can declare that something is a string by putting characters in quotation marks (either \" or ' is fine):"
