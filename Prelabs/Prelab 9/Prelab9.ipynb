Below, I provide links to some likely candidates, but you can also propose a database or tabular dataset that you find. Similarly, if there is a particuar area of astronomy that you are interested in exploring and that is not represented in the datasets below, please get in touch and I will try to help you find an appropriate tabular dataset.  \n","\n","***If you choose a dataset that is NOt one of the six below, you MUST clear it with me by Wednesday, May 5***. \n","\n","1) [The Gaia Archive](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/)     \n","2) [The IPAC Infrared Science Archive](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/)   \n","3) [Kepler and K2 Data Archives](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/data-products.html)    \n","4) [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Catalog](https://www.sdss.org/dr12/data_access/)  \n","5) [NASA Extragalactic Database](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/byparams)    \n","6) [JPL Solar System Dynamics Databse](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?phys_data)  \n","\n","***Note that you should read the instructions for Step 2, and perhaps try reading in the data and exploring it a bit (Exercise 2) before arriving at your final decision and completing Exercise 1***\n","\n","### Exercise 1 - Basically a rough draft of your introduction\n","\n","Once you have chosen a dataset, describe in 1 paragraph why you have chosen it. What interests you about it and why? What sorts of intersting questions or data-driven investigations do you imaging it might be capable of answering?\n","\n","In a second paragraph, describe the nature of the dataset. What information does it contain and about what kind of astronomical objects? Link at least three resources that you will use to learn about that type of object. \n","\n","In a final paragraph, describe based on what you can find in the documentation for your chosen database how the data it contains were collected. Were they obtained uniformly or with multiple instruments? What kinds of sampling or selection effects might be at play? How will you treat these as you conduct your investigation?\n","\n","## Step 2 - Explore the data\n","\n","You need to be able to work with the dataset that you have chosen, which may involve some legwork to accomplish. Some databases are easier to access and manipulate than others. To support this, first a few words of caution:\n","\n",">Note that your final project investigation needs to involve tabular data that can be imported into Pandas. This means that images, time series data, spectra, etc. are off limits (not because they aren't interesting - only because they are complex and outside of the scope of this class).\n","\n",">Most of the databases linked above are massive. In some cases, you may be able to import the entire archive and pare it down after importing it, but in many cases you will want to use the tools provided on the websites to select some interesting subset of the data (e.g. a particular type of object, a \"volume-limited\" sample of objects within some set distance from Earth, a random sample, or a particular, reasonably-representative area of sky) before even downloading it. This will likely require some trial and error. \n","\n","### Exercise 2 - Basically a rough draft of your procedure\n","\n","Download and read in your chosen dataset (which, as noted above, may be only a subset of the data in one of the databases above).\n","\n","In 1-2 paragraphs, describe in words what you've done. How many objects/measurements does the full database contain? If you selected a subset of data for your analysis, describe how much of it remains after you've done your selection and justify your choice of subsample. Describe in words such that a peer could reproduce what you've done the process you undertook to find, select, download, and read it into python\n","\n","In many cases, this justification of a subsample will require some legwork. Some example considerations are given below.\n","\n",">If you have selected a ***volume-limited sample*** (returning, say, only objects within some distance of earth), you will have to make an argument regarding whether your sample is complete or not, for example by varying the volume. In principle, increasing the distance should increase the number of objects by an amount proportional to the additional volume if the sample is complete. You may wish to extract samples with several volumes and use the information you glean from them to establish that volume. \n","> If you've selected a ***random sample***, you should repeat the process a number of times and get a sense for how much it varies. In principle, you should get roughly the same number of objects each time unless other factors are at play (e.g. one sample is in the plane of our galaxy and one sample is out of it). In all cases, you will likely want to keep several separate random samples for use in your investigation so that you can support any conclusions you draw by demonstrating reproducability. \n","> If you've selected only a certain type of object or selected data based on a measured property, justify this choice, including describing what effect this is likely to have in introducing biases into the data. You may wish to extract data for multiple types of objects or multiple ranges of a parameter to quantify these effects.\n","\n","## Step 3 - Figure out what you have\n","\n","Next, you should explore the columns in your dataset. Much like the transition between Step 1 and Step 2, this investigation might result in your revisiting or revising some of your ideas from Step 2. \n","\n","### Exercise 3 - Make a data dictionary\n","\n","Begin by creating a \"data dictionary\" for all columns in your dataset. You can make it in Google sheets and link it in your proposal or make one in markdown like the example below. \n","\n","Constructing your data dictionary will require some reading about the nature of the data contained in your database. Some variables may be harder to track down than others. You can leave question marks in your data dictionary at this stage for things that you have trouble finding and your TAs and I will help you track them down, but your table should be reasonably complete to receive full credit for this exercise. \n","\n","If you have a dataset with more than 15 columns, choose the 15 that you think are likely to be the most informative to your investigation for inclusion in your Data Dictionary. If your chosen dataset includes fewer than 15 columns, include them all. If it has fewer than 5 columns, it is not sufficient for this project and you will have to choose another. \n","\n","| Column Name | Quantity | Variable Type | Units or Number | How Derived/Notes |\n","| :---        |    :---   |   :--- | : --- | :--- |\n","| pl_orbsmax  | Planet semi-major axis | Numerical | astronomical units (au) | observed (DI and microlensing), <br /> inferred (RV and transit) |\n","| pl_discmeth   | Detection method | Categorical | 4 main values <br /> (Direct imaging, Transits,<br /> Radial Velocity, Microlensing) | Specifies method used for <br /> FIRST observation of this planet | \n","\n","## Step 4 - Explore Distributions\n","A first step in exploring your database involves understanding how the key variables are distributed - what are their ranges/possible values? Do they span a wide enough range that you will need a log scale? Is there evidence for more than one population?\n","\n","### Exercise 4 - Make some histograms\n","\n","Using your data dictionary and some exploratory visualizations, identify ***at least five*** particularly interesting or informative numerical columns in the dataset and make histograms of the distribution of values for each. This is a good opportunity to practice making user-defined bins, which you are required to do for this project. Refer back to Prelab 7 for more information about how to do so. You may also wish to log scale the quantities before making histograms if they span a particularly wide range of values. \n","\n","For each of your five chosen variables, write a description of its distribution below your final histogram. For example (numbers fabricated, but based on an investigation you did of the exoplanet database): \n",">\"Planetary mass is a quantity that is directly measurable by the radial velocity and microlensing detection methods, and is estimated or inferred for directly imaged and transiting planets based on other observed properties. The overall distribution of mass values for the exoplanet database is bimodal with one peak near 1 earth mass and a second peak near 10 earth masses. Dividing the data into two populations with a dividing line at 5 earth masses results in 53 objects in the lower mass ($<$5 earth mass) group, with a median of 1.2 earth masses and a standard deviation of 0.5 earth masses, and 175 objects in the higher mass (>5 earth mass) group, with a median of 12 earth masses and a standard deviation of 2 earth masses.\"\n","\n","## Step/Exercise 5 - Propose Two Possible Investigations\n","\n","Finally, propose in detail two questions that you think this dataset is able to answer/inform. Your proposal should include a detailed explanation of how you arrived at those questions and should demonstrate through exploratory calculations/visualizations that these questions are tractable (e.g. the dataset is capable of answering it, the population that you wish to study is sufficiently distinct in certain variables, etc.).\n","\n","Justify in one paragraph each why you think these questions might be interesting/important. You should connect your questions to your background reading wherever possible and provide links.\n","\n","There are no formal requirements for what kinds of visualizations/calculations you must complete to develop these questions, but I provide some guiding questions/suggestions below.\n","\n","1. Did any of your step 4 histograms show bimodal distributions or do you have any categorical variables in your dataset? If so, consider comparing those populations through overlapping histograms (1D, 2 populations), boxplots (1D, more than 2 populations), or scatteplots (2D, use colors or symbols for populations). Can you form them into a hypothesis test?\n","\n","2. Are any of the variables that you identified in Step 4 correlated? Make a multipanel set of scatter plots plotting every variable vs. every other. Try making it in linear and log space. Do any of these data show linear trends that are potentially interesting (perhaps they have correlation coefficients in the ~0.3-0.8 range, which usually indicate meaningful, non-calculated quantities)? If you identify relationships, consider ***how or why*** the variables might be related pairwise and more broadly. Could you be seeing a selection effect? If you see multiple correlations, could they all be related to one another? \n","\n"," "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"whKIIVIUy7bT"},"source":["#Insert lots of code and markdown cells for your proposal below"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
