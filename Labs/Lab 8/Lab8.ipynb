Use the numpy.random.multivariate_normal function to create a bivariate normal distribution with the same properties as Hubble's original data. You will have to read the help function to figure out what input to give it, and I highly suggest that you write a few tests and make sure your output makes sense before moving on. \n","\n",">*Hint: you will need some summary statistics from the original data, plus a covariance matrix to create this distribution*.   \n","\n","2. Create a multipanel 2x4 grid of plots (see Prelab 7 for help with setting up multipanel plots), each of which should be a scatter plot with 24 points (as in Hubble's original data) randomly drawn from the distribution you established in (1).   \n","3. Fit a line to the data in each plot and include the correlation coefficient and slope (also known as the hubble constant, make sure to include units) in the legend of each subpanel. Think carefully about which of the correlation coefficients you investigated in Lab 6 is most appropriate for this dataset. Make sure to justify your choice in your final writeup.    \n","4. Now write a function that will draw an arbitrary number (n) of random 24 point realizations from the distribution and return an array of the best fit slopes and correlation coefficients.  In other words, write a simulation that will (a) do this same process of randomly drawing and fitting 24 data points an arbitrarily large  number of times (n) and (b) assemble a list (a sampling distribution!) of the best fit slopes and correlation coefficients. \n","5. Create overlapping histograms or boxplots that compare the sampling distributions returned by your function for different numbers of random realizations/draws (different n values). Note any changes in the distribution with the number of total realizations and make an argument for how many you think you \"need\" to answer the question in your final writeup.    \n","6. Use your sampling distributions and visualizations of them to design and complete a hypothesis test. There are many possibilities - start by formulating a \"null hypothesis\". Ask if you want help/guidance.      \n","7. At the bottom of this notebook, write a 3-5 paragraph summary describing the results of this investigation, including: methods, findings, and conclusions. Make explicit connections to as many ideas from this unit as you can, and include specific references to the plots that you designed following the instructions above. Justify any choices that you made (e.g. choice of correlation coefficient, number of random realizations). End with a paragraph describing how you think this kind of simulation might be useful generally (e.g. what types of questions might you be able to answer with this or a similar technique)?
